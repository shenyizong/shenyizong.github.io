Hi Welcome to my Blog where I keep the thoughts. I'm a[RStudio, Inc](http://www.rstudio.com).
I got my PhD from the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. My
[thesis](http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13518/) was _Dynamic
[Graphics](http://cranvas.org) and [Reporting](/knitr) for Statistics_, advised
by [Di](http://dicook.public.iastate.edu) and
[Heike](http://hofmann.public.iastate.edu). I have been developing a few
[R](http://www.r-project.org) packages either seriously or for
[fun](http://cran.r-project.org/package=fun) (or both), such as
[animation](/animation), [formatR](/formatR), and [knitr](/knitr). I founded
a Chinese website called "[Capital of Statistics](http://cos.name)" in 2006,
which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. I also
initiated the first Chinese R conference in 2008. Besides statistics, I'm a
big fan of [GitHub](https://github.com/yihui), [LyX](http://www.lyx.org) and
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). I hate IE. I fall asleep when I
see beamer slides, and I yell at people who use `\textbf{}` to write
`\title{}`. I know I cannot eat code, so I cook almost every day to stay
away from my computer for two hours.

我是沈一宗。欢迎来到我的博客，记录我指尖思考的地方。
鄙人好咖啡，爱电影，喜数码，非主流果粉，标准宅男一名。文青谈不上，嗜书成瘾，发现读的越多懂的越少。30而立，娶贤妻得贵子，2014年我携妻带子来到澳洲，迈入人生新的阶段。

我向往自由自在的码农生活，沉迷阅读及思考。

> 大江東去，浪淘盡、千古風流人物。故壘西邊人道是，三國周郎赤壁。亂石穿空，驚濤拍岸，捲起千堆雪。江山如畫，一時多少豪傑  
> 遙想公瑾當年，小喬初嫁了，雄姿英發。羽扇綸巾，談笑間，檣櫓灰飛煙滅。故國神遊，多情應笑我，早生華髮。人間如夢，一樽還酹江月。
